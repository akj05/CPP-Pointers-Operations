🧵 Pointer Operations in C++

🎯 Aim

To study and implement pointer operations in C++ and understand the difference between call by value and call by reference parameter-passing methods.

📚 Theory

In C++, the way we pass parameters to functions determines whether changes inside the function affect the original variables.

📦 Call by Value

    Definition: A copy of the actual parameter is passed to the function.
    Effect: Changes happen only on the copy → originals remain unchanged.
    Working: Function operates in its own scope and does not affect caller variables.


🔗 Call by Reference

    Definition: The address or reference of actual parameters is passed, allowing direct modification of originals.
    Effect: Changes done inside the function reflect in the caller variables.
    Working: Function receives pointers (or references) → dereferences them to access and modify actual memory.

⚙️ Feature 	📦 Call by Value 	🔗 Call by Reference
Data Passed 	Copy of value 	Address / reference
Changes affect original 	❌ No 	✅ Yes
Memory Use 	Extra copy made 	No extra copy
Safety 	Safer (no side effects) 	Can change caller data
Typical Use Case 	Read-only operations 	In-place modifications

📋 Algorithms
🔹 Employee Salary Increment Check

    Start
    Input details:
        yearsCompleted → Number of years employee has worked
        hasResearchProjects → Worked on research projects (Yes/No)
        hasNewProjectPipeline → New research project in pipeline (Yes/No)
        profitGenerated → Profit generated in Rs
        currentSalary → Current salary of employee
    Call function checkIncrement() by passing addresses of above values.
    Inside function:
        Initialize conditionsMet = 0
        If yearsCompleted >= 1, increment conditionsMet.
        If hasResearchProjects == true, increment conditionsMet.
        If hasNewProjectPipeline == true, increment conditionsMet.
        If profitGenerated > 100000, increment conditionsMet.
    If conditionsMet >= 3:
        Increase salary by 20%
        Print "Eligible for increment" and new salary
    Else:
        Print "Not eligible for increment" and unchanged salary
    End

🔹 Reverse a String using Pointers

    Start
    Input a string str1.
    Find length of string → n = str1.length().
    Store base address of string in a pointer: ptr = &str1[0].
    Display message "Reversed String".
    Loop from i = n - 1 to 0:
        Print *(ptr + i)
    After loop ends, reversed string is displayed.
    End

🧠 Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the difference between parameter-passing methods in C++.

    📦 Call by Value → Works on copies, originals remain safe.
    🔗 Call by Reference → Works directly on real data, originals are modified.
    ✅ Key Insight:
        Use Call by Value for safety (read-only operations).
        Use Call by Reference for in-place updates and efficiency.
